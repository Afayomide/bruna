         HOW TO CLEAN THE PARTS?

         Cleaning correctly is essential to preserve the shine and durability of semi-jewelry. It is recommended to clean them regularly or whenever the pieces come into contact with sweat, chlorine or sea water.
  
  To clean properly, you need a container, neutral detergent or soap, warm water and a soft cloth. 
   <ul className="faqs-list">

  <li><BsCheck/> First, place the semi-jewels in a container and pour in warm water with neutral detergent.
 </li>

  <li><BsCheck/>Leave the pieces to soak for a few hours and then change the water, adding the detergent and warm water again, leaving the pieces to soak for a few more hours. </li>
  <li><BsCheck/>Then, remove the pieces from the container and rinse well under running water. Afterwards, dry them with a soft cloth or a hairdryer. And your parts are cleaned!</li>
   </ul>
  <br/>For more practical and simple cleaning, use a flannel to polish your semi-jewelry after wearing it. Taking this care further helps preserve the pieces.

         <p>
         To preserve the quality and ensure greater durability of semi-jewelry, choosing a suitable place to store it is an extremely important step and should not be neglected.
   <ul className="faqs-list">
  <li><BsCheck/> It is recommended to set a clean and dry place, free from sun exposure, light and humidity. Choose to store semi-jewelry in compartments lined with soft fabric to help eliminate moisture and prevent the pieces from being scratched. For those who live in more humid regions, it is worth placing a piece of school chalk inside the compartment where the pieces are stored to absorb moisture.</li>

  <li><BsCheck/>Jewelry boxes, lined drawers and compartments or even velvet, satin or suede bags are great options to prevent semi-jewelry from coming into contact with other objects that could damage it. However, the ideal is that the fabrics and bags do not have strong colors, as the paint can stain the pieces. </li>
  <li><BsCheck/>Furthermore, the ideal is to store accessories separately from each other to prevent them from becoming tangled and suffering from scratches or other signs of poor conservation.</li>

DIFFERENCES BETWEEN SEMI-JEWELRY AND COSTUME JEWELRY
    </h4>
    <div className="faq-display">
    <p>
    Semi-jewels are known for being more resistant and sophisticated compared to costume jewelry. But after all, do you know what makes each of them different? So, come and learn about the main differences between semi-jewelry and costume jewelry:
<ul className="faqs-list">

<li><BsDot/> The  semi-jewels  are hypoallergenic, as they are nickel-free. Jewelry  contains nickel and other heavy metals in its composition ,  which can cause skin irritation.
</li>

<li><BsDot/>The  semi-jewels  are plated with noble metals, such as gold. While  costume jewelry  is plated with inferior materials.</li>
<li><BsDot/>The  semi-jewelry stones  are set in the metal itself, which prevents the stones from coming loose. The stones in  jewelry  are usually just glued together, making it easier for the stones to fall out.</li>
<li><BsDot/>In addition to being more durable,  semi-jewels  have more shine and a better finish. Jewelry  has low durability, less shine and a burred ,  unpolished finish.</li>

    <p>
    Bruna's semi-jewels are highly accepted pieces in the market due to their advanced design and the quality of their plating. Therefore, some companies, with the intention of confusing the customer, try to copy our pieces, even imitating the logo. Therefore, always be aware of imitations.
    </p>
    <p>
    Our semi-jewelry always comes with the Bruna brand cast or engraved on the piece. Therefore, to identify Bruna's true semi-jewelry, simply check whether the piece has this marking.
    </p>
    <img loading="lazy" src={identify1}/>
    <img loading="lazy" src={identify2}/>
    <p>On smaller pieces, the Bruna brand is engraved on the pins and tuners. On the chains, a stamp in the shape of the Bruna logo is welded together with the clasp.

    Bruna Semijoias is a consolidated brand in the market and recognized for the quality and sophistication of its pieces. This recognition is due to our difference, which is associated with several factors that certify the high quality standard of our semi-jewelry.
    </p>
    <p>
    Sophisticated design, prototyping with 3D technology, detailed finishing and the amount of gold ensure that our pieces have a longer useful life.Sophisticated design, prototyping with 3D technology, detailed finishing and the amount of gold ensure that our pieces have a longer useful life.
    </p>
    <p>
    There are two bathing techniques, one by weight (thousandths) and another by area (microns). Our pieces are plated by area, ensuring a more homogeneous and better quality bath, as the micron corresponds to a larger layer of gold compared to the thousandths. It is worth remembering that Bruna is one of the brands that deposits the most microns in its semi-jewelry. All this commitment makes Bruna stand out in the plated jewelry sector.
